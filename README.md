# Cityline-Syracuse
The project, for data-driven decision-making class, required students to apply Python skills to merge, clean, and analyze several datasets, and to interpret the results to make policy recommendations. My colleagues, Daniela and Hailey, and I decided to focus on trash-related complaints to the City of Syracuse.
The project addresses the following two research questions: 
1) Whether there is a pattern in the demographic profile of Syracuseâ€™s TnT sectors and the frequency of trash complaints.
2) Whether there is a pattern in the time it takes to resolve trash complaints across neighborhood.
The demographics examined are foreign-born status, education level and median income. Close times were used to address whether there was a pattern in the time to resolve.

## Datasets
The research is based on three datasets: Cityline Calls for Service (Cityline), Parcel Data April 2018 (Parcel), and American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates from 2013-2017. The first two datasets are collected and managed by the city of Syracuse and ACS is accessed via Social Explorer.
+ Cityline: contains 57,110 complaints about non-emergency problems in the city of Syracuse received through the Cityline system.
+ Parcel: contains 41,623 entries of parcel information.
+ ACS: contains 140 census tracts and demographic information for each tract in the county.
